# Somali-Text-Summarization-using-NLP
abstractive and extractive Somali Text Summarization using NLP

**Desciption**
the project aims to provide a summarization of the dataset that contains significant or large text content.
Some articles provide unnecessary content that changes the meaning of the article. So, the user may need help to get the exact information a user wants. 
Here, Text Summarization using NLP plays a crucial role by summarizing the text without changing the exact meaning of the text. 
It also helps to remove unnecessary sentences and paragraphs from vast text content. This project will be helpful for students, researchers, and news reporters. 
They can use this tool to summarize the topic of a research paper or any news report to understand and present it. 
Students can use this tool to read and understand any topic more thoroughly. Researchers can use this tool to study any research work they are doing. 
Text summarization can be done extractively and abstractly. 
Extractive summarization involves the extraction of the text from the enormous text article such that the meaning of the article does not change. 
In contrast, abstractive summarization will write a summary of the article. Here, we use extractive summarization because it tries to keep the article's sentences and the meaning the same. 
It also maintains the exact meaning of the article. It will not change the essential meaning of the text content. The extractive text summarization will involve the process of tokenization, sentence scoring, and selection.
Tokenization divides the sentences and words into tokens so that it can find the word that has been repeatedly frequently placed the word in the correct place.
